# Selection Sort

```python
def selection_sort(A):
    n = len(A)
    for i in range(n):
        smallest = i
        # Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if A[smallest] > A[j]:
                smallest = j
        # Swap the found smallest element with the first element of the unsorted portion
        if smallest != i:
            A[i], A[smallest] = A[smallest], A[i]
    print(A)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    A = [100, 8, 9, 7, 6, 4, 6, 8, 4, 231, 884, 54]
    selection_sort(A)
```
